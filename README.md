# RoR Run Visualizer

A data visualizer for events within a Risk of Rain 2 run. Using the flutter app framework, so don't blame me if it looks bad.

# What's it do?

## Full item analysis

Taking a json representation of the run (`.run.json`), it creates a nice little bar that shows all the items collected, deaths, and bosses on a timeline. Only supports the analysis of a singe run.
